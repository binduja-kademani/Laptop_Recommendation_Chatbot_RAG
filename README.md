## ‚ú® About the Project  
The Laptop Recommendation Assistant with Full RAG leverages a dynamic dataset of 900+ laptops stored in a `.csv` file, updated weekly to ensure recommendations are always accurate and up-to-date. By combining real-time retrieval from the dataset with the contextual understanding of GPT models, the chatbot delivers precise, data-driven, and personalized laptop recommendations tailored to user preferences.

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges/Issues Faced with fixes
- [Issue 1](GPT model Generation is probabilistic in nature. Meaning response from GPT for the same Query might be different. This nature of GPT models are
not usually accepted by general user. So I have added 'Temperature' parameter to the requests with low value to make the models perform in thier lowest
probabilistic settings, so it generally provides reproducable output)

- [Issue 2](Reworked on the logic and updated prompts to include few instructions to generate more relevant answers to the user queries. This was done to improve the quality of the answers to the user queries.)

---

## üöÄ Future Scope  
- Automate weekly updates with real-time scraping from trusted e-commerce sites.  
- Enhance dataset fields to include additional metrics like warranty details and user reviews.  
- Introduce dynamic API integrations for live pricing and stock availability.
